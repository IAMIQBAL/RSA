# RSA Implementation in C

This program implements the RSA cryptosystem algorithm. It selects two prime numbers which are (65537, 19) and uses them to produce the public and private keys. Using the keys, it can either encrypt or decrypt the sentence that is inputted by the user using the RSA algorithm.
